# Second Chance Policy Data Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing the impact of the Second Chance Policy (SCP) on student performance in CS110 and CS170 courses at Rutgers University, New Brunswick's Computer Science department.

## Overview

The analysis explores how the SCP affects students across different demographic groups, focusing on gender, URM (Underrepresented Minority) status, and instruction mode (in-person vs. online).

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preparation for CS110 and CS170 courses
- Descriptive statistics generation
- Visualization of demographic distributions and SCP benefits
- Comparative analysis between courses and demographic groups

## Visualizations

The script generates several visualizations, including:
- Gender and URM distribution in CS110 and CS170
- Percentage of students benefiting from SCP by course, gender, and URM status
- Comparison of SCP benefits for in-person vs. online instruction (CS110 only)

## Data Privacy

**Note: The dataset used in this analysis is not publicly available due to privacy considerations.**

## Usage

1. Ensure R and required packages (tidyverse, readxl, dplyr, gridExtra, ggplot2) are installed
2. Set working directory to the project folder
3. Request access to the dataset from the project administrator
4. Run the R script to perform analysis and generate visualizations
